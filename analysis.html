            <h2>Quarterback Salaries vs QBR</h2>
            <p>
                We analyzed the relationship between team spending on quarterbacks and on-field efficiency. The scatter plot below shows each team-season’s weighted QBR against its total quarterback salary. The fitted line indicates a weak positive relationship (Pearson correlation = 0.10). In other words, higher spending on quarterbacks shows only a modest association with better quarterback performance.

            <h2>Running Back Salaries vs RBR</h2>
            <p>
                Similarly, we plotted team spending on running backs against our Running Back Rating. The scatter plot and regression line reveal an even weaker relationship (Pearson correlation = -0.14). This suggests that paying running backs more does not strongly translate into higher rushing efficiency.

            <h2>Do Quarterbacks or Running Backs Matter More for Winning?</h2>
            <p>
                To assess which position drives team success, we correlated our performance metrics with team wins. The left plot shows that team weighted QBR has a stronger positive correlation with wins (Pearson r = 0.66) than running back efficiency does (Pearson r = 0.00). While correlation does not imply causation, this analysis suggests that quarterback play is more closely associated with winning than running back production.

            <p>
                Overall, our regression and correlation analyses indicate that while teams must pay quarterbacks a premium, the return on investment is only moderately positive. In contrast, spending on running backs offers little explanatory power for performance or wins. Moreover, quarterback performance has a stronger relationship with winning than running back efficiency does, underscoring the importance of quarterback play in today’s NFL.
