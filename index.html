      <h2>Top Quarterbacks by QBR (2015–2025)</h2>
      <p>
        This chart shows the top five quarterbacks in each season ranked by
        Total Quarterback Rating (QBR). QBR is designed to capture a
        quarterback’s overall impact on winning beyond traditional passing
        statistics.

        and production.

      <h2>How the Metrics Work</h2>

      <h3>Quarterback Rating (QBR)</h3>
      <p>
        Total Quarterback Rating (QBR) is ESPN’s comprehensive quarterback
        metric designed to measure a player’s overall contribution to winning.
        It is built on Expected Points Added (EPA) and incorporates passing,
        rushing, sacks, turnovers, and penalties. The metric adjusts for game
        context such as down, distance, score, time remaining, and opponent
        strength. QBR is reported on a 0–100 scale, where 50 represents league
        average performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Running Back Rating (RBR)</h3>
      <p>
        Running Back Rating (RBR) is a custom metric created for this project to
        evaluate running back performance in a consistent, data-driven way.
        RBR combines four season-level components: Success Rate, Yards per
        Attempt, Total Rushing Yards, and Total Touchdowns. Each component is
        normalized within a season and equally weighted, allowing the metric
        to reflect both efficiency and workload rather than raw volume alone.
